Alg3: 6.1 Weighted Interval Scheduling? p.280-281. No memoization, plus sorting, which should make it O(2^n + n^2) -> O(2^n)

Alg4: 
A. 6.1 Weighted Interval Scheduling? p. 282-284. Requires sorting, which should make it O(n^2 + n + n) -> O(n^2) using memoization. Selection sort?
B. 6.2 Memoization vs. Iteration? p.284-285. Replace the memoization part with iterative, the rest in A applies (i thihk)

Alg5: 6.4 Subset Sum and Knapsacks from textbook? p.294-297. Does not require sorting, making it O(n + n) -> O(n)

These are rough ideas, probably need to alter them to fit our situation better
