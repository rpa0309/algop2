# algop2

Alg3: Brute force; iterate over the vault list multiple times?

Alg4: 6.1 Weighted Interval Scheduling? p. 282-284. Requires sorting, which should make it O(n^2 + n + n) -> O(n^2)

Alg5: 6.4 Subset Sum and Knapsacks from textbook? p.294-297. Does not require sorting, making it O(n + n) -> O(n)

These are rough ideas, probably need to alter them to fit our situation better
